### Data Structures

#### Player
```solidity
struct Player {
    uint256 totalToppings;      // Total toppings earned
    uint256 dailyEntries;       // Total daily game entries
    uint256 weeklyEntries;      // Total weekly game entries
    uint256 lastEntryTime;      // Timestamp of last entry
    uint256 streakDays;         // Current streak days
    uint256 lastStreakUpdate;   // Last streak update timestamp
    bool isBlacklisted;         // Blacklist status
}
```

#### Referral
```solidity
struct Referral {
    address referrer;           // Referrer address
    uint256 totalReferrals;     // Total successful referrals
    uint256 totalRewards;       // Total rewards earned
    bool isActive;              // Referral status
}
```

#### Game
```solidity
struct Game {
    uint256 gameId;             // Unique game identifier
    uint256 startTime;          // Game start timestamp
    uint256 endTime;            // Game end timestamp
    uint256 totalEntries;       // Total player entries
    uint256 jackpotAmount;      // Total jackpot amount
    address[] winners;          // Array of winner addresses
    bool isCompleted;           // Game completion status
}
```

### Events

#### Game Events
```solidity
event PlayerEntered(address indexed player, uint256 gameId, uint256 entryFee);
event DailyWinnersSelected(uint256 gameId, address[] winners, uint256 jackpotAmount);
event WeeklyWinnersSelected(uint256 gameId, address[] winners, uint256 jackpotAmount);
```

#### Reward Events
```solidity
event ToppingsAwarded(address indexed player, uint256 amount, string reason);
event ReferralCreated(address indexed referrer, string referralCode);
event ReferralUsed(address indexed referrer, address indexed newPlayer, uint256 reward);
```

#### Admin Events
```solidity
event PlayerBlacklisted(address indexed player, bool blacklisted);
event EmergencyPause(bool paused);
event JackpotUpdated(uint256 dailyJackpot, uint256 weeklyJackpot);
```

### Security Considerations

#### Reentrancy Protection
- All external functions use `nonReentrant` modifier
- Token transfers happen after state updates
- Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern

#### Access Control
- Owner functions protected by `onlyOwner` modifier
- Critical functions require owner privileges
- Emergency functions for contract management

#### Input Validation
- Address validation for all address inputs
- String validation for referral codes
- Balance checks before token operations

#### Emergency Procedures
- Pause functionality for emergency situations
- Blacklist system for malicious addresses
- Emergency withdrawal for contract owner

### Gas Optimization

#### Storage Optimization
- Packed structs to reduce storage costs
- Efficient mapping usage
- Minimal storage operations

#### Function Optimization
- Batch operations where possible
- Efficient loops and iterations
- Minimal external calls

### Deployment

#### Base Network Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia

# Deploy to Base mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base
```

#### Verification
```bash
# Verify on Basescan
npx hardhat verify --network base 0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS "0x2213414893259b0C48066Acd1763e7fbA97859E5"
```

### Testing

#### Test Coverage
```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run security tests
npx hardhat test test/security/

# Run integration tests
npx hardhat test test/integration/

# Gas optimization tests
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
